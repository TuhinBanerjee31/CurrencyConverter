# Lessons Learned


During the development of this application, I delved into a pivotal component of React Native known as 'FlatList'. Through this process, I gained insights into the distinctions between 'ScrollView' and 'FlatList', recognizing the advantages of the latter. Additionally, I encountered novel challenges when deploying the app on mobile, pinpointing a Gradle-related issue which I successfully resolved with the assistance of Stack Overflow. Furthermore, I expanded my repertoire with the discovery of the highly beneficial React Native npm package, 'Snackbar'.
